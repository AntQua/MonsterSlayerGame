# Monster Slayer Game

## Overview
I'm Learning Vue.js 3!
Monster Slayer is a simple, interactive game built with Vue.js as part of an exercise project from Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller's Udemy Course: [Vue - The Complete Guide].

Players battle a monster, with options to attack, perform a special attack, heal, or surrender.

## Gameplay

- **Surrender**: Ends the game with the monster as the winner.
